My .emacs.d configuration files
===============================

These are my Emacs configuration files. Follow the instructions in order to get them working:

* Backup your ``~/.emacs`` and ``~/.emacs.d`` files!
* ``pip install autopep8``
* ``pip install flake8``
* ``pip install jedi`` (You can use your favorite package installer, actually what I use is conda)
* ``git clone https://github.com/pablordrrbl/dot-emacs.git .emacs.d``
